**Micromechanics of non-linear modes**
<br/>

<br/>
The micromechanics of non-linear modes (orange displacement field) allows one to measure the coupling between soft spots in structural glasses and predict the sequence of plastic instabilities prior to the nucleation of a shear band (blue cumulative plastic deformation).

<br/>
Local yield stress map extracted from an analytical nonlinear strain expansion inside spherical cavities that are deformed within a rigid matrix. Blue spots correspond to small stress activations marking the presence of permanent localization.

Local product between the first and second derivative of the potential energy with respect to the strain of a simple shear deformation. Blue and red regions will destabilize and stabilize, respectively.</figcaption>
