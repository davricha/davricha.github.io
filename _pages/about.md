<!-- 
I am an independent Marie Sklodowska-Curie fellow working at the “Laboratoire Interdisciplinaire de Physique” in Grenoble (France). My research focuses on the statistical mechanics of systems out of equilibrium, including $$\color{blue}{phase transitions}}}$$, $$\color{red}{elasticity}}}$$, $$\color{green}{plasticity}}}$$, and $$\color{orange}{failure}}}$$ in amorphous materials. My research is heavily based on developing and using advanced numerical methods.
