<em> The micromechanics of non-linear modes $$d\pid/\gamma$$ (orange displacement field) allows one to measure the coupling between soft spots in structural glasses and predict the sequence of plastic instabilities prior to the nucleation of a shear band (blue cumulative plastic deformation).</em>

<em>Local yield stress map extracted from an analytical nonlinear strain expansion of the stress inside spherical cavities that are embedded in a affinely deformed rigid matrix. Blue spots correspond to small stress activations, marking the presence of a permanent strain localization.</em>
