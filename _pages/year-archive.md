<h1>Mechanical heterogeneities in colloidal gels</h1> Growing mechanical heterogeneity in colloidal gels approaching the rigidity transition. A dense (blue) and dilute (orange) gel configurations and linear responses to local strain are shown on the left and right, respectively.

<em> <h1>**Micromechanics of non-linear modes</h1> The micromechanics of non-linear modes (orange displacement field) allows one to measure the coupling between soft spots in structural glasses and predict the sequence of plastic instabilities prior to the nucleation of a shear band (blue cumulative plastic deformation).</em>

<em>Local yield stress map extracted from an analytical nonlinear strain expansion of the stress inside spherical cavities that are embedded in a affinely deformed rigid matrix. Blue spots correspond to small stress activations, marking the presence of a permanent strain localization.</em>

<em>Local product between the first and second derivative of the potential energy with respect to the strain for a simple shear deformation. Blue and red regions will destabilize and stabilize upon loading, respectively.</em>
