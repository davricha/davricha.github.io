<em>The micromechanics of non-linear modes (orange displacement field) allows one to measure the coupling between soft spots in structural glasses and predict the sequence of plastic instabilities prior to the nucleation of a shear band (blue cumulative plastic deformation).</em>

<em>Local yield stress map extracted from an analytical nonlinear strain expansion inside spherical cavities that are deformed within a rigid matrix. Blue spots correspond to small stress activations marking the presence of permanent localization.</em>

<em>Local product between the first and second derivative of the potential energy with respect to the strain for a simple shear deformation. Blue and red regions will destabilize and stabilize, respectively.</em>
