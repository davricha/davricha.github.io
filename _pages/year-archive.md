  <figcaption>The micromechanics of non-linear modes (orange displacement field) allows one to measure the coupling between soft spots in structural glasses and predict the sequence of plastic instabilities prior to the nucleation of a shear band (blue cumulative plastic deformation).</figcaption>

  <figcaption> Local yield stress map extracted from an analytical non-linear strain expansion inside spherical cavities that are deformed within a rigid matrix. Blue spots mark soft regions with a small stress activation.</figcaption>
