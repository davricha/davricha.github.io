I am a postdoctoral researcher working at the interface between physics and mechanics with a focus on systems out of equilibrium. My research includes the modeling of phase transitions in driven systems and understanding failure mechanisms in amorphous solids such as glasses and gels. My work is heavily based on developing advanced numerical methods, in close collaboration with experimentalists.
