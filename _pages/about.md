I am an independent Marie Sklodowska-Curie fellow working at the “Laboratoire Interdisciplinaire de Physique” in Grenoble (France). My research focuses on the statistical mechanics of systems out of equilibrium, including phase transitions, plasticity and failure in amorphous materials. My research is heavily based on developing and using advanced numerical methods.
