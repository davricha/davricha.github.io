I am an independent Marie Sklodowska-Curie fellow working at the “Laboratoire Interdisciplinaire de Physique” in Grenoble (France). My research focuses on the statistical mechanics of systems out of equilibrium, including $\color{blue}{phase \space transitions}$, $\color{red}{elasticity}$, $\color{green}{plasticity}$, and $\color{orange}{failure}$ in amorphous materials. My research is heavily based on developing and using advanced numerical methods.
